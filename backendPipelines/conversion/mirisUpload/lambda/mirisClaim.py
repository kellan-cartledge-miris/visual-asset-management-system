"""
Claim-key derivation and release for the Miris upload dedup gate.

The gate writes a claim, and several later steps have to delete the *same* object when the run
does not succeed. Both halves live here so the key can only ever be derived one way.

The key is deterministic on the asset and the content of its USD layers and sits at the auxiliary
bucket ROOT: ``locks/miris-upload/{assetId}/{fingerprint}.claim``. The fingerprint is a digest of
the asset-relative key and ETag of every file under the asset root whose extension can trigger the
pipeline, so every execution fanned out from one upload computes the same key, and a changed or
added layer computes a new one. Only the BUCKET is taken from the auxiliary URI: its prefix is
scoped to the workflow execution, so folding the prefix into the key would give every fanned-out
execution a different key and defeat the dedup entirely.

A successful upload retires the asset's claims on any other content, so the only claim left is the
one for the content Miris streams.
