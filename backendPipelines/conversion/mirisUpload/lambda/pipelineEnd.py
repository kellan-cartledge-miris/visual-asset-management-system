"""Step Functions Task Token callback. Reports back to the outer VAMS workflow.

Invoked two ways: by the inner state machine's own end states, and by an Amazon EventBridge rule on
the inner execution's FAILED, TIMED_OUT and ABORTED status changes. The rule covers the ends no state
inside the execution can reach, a state machine timeout or a stopped execution, which would otherwise
leave the outer workflow task waiting out its own timeout and the claim in place.

A run that does not succeed also releases the dedup claim the gate wrote, so the same content is
eligible again for the next trigger. A successful run keeps its claim: that record is what collapses
the per-file trigger fan-out and repeat triggers on unchanged content. It also retires the asset's
claims on other content, so a later trigger on earlier content (a reverted version) uploads again.
