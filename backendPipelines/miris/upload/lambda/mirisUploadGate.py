Miris Upload Gate Lambda.

A fileUpload trigger fires once per uploaded file, so a multi-file USD asset fans out to one
execution per matching layer, each of which would package the same dependency graph and create a
duplicate Miris asset. This gate collapses that fan-out to a single upload.

The claim is an S3 conditional put (``If-None-Match: *``) at a key derived from the asset and the
content of its USD layers (``mirisClaim.claim_location``): the gate lists the files under the asset
root whose extension can trigger the pipeline and fingerprints their keys and ETags. Every execution
fanned out from one upload computes the same key, while a changed or added layer computes a new one
and uploads again. Exactly one caller can create the object; every other caller receives
``PreconditionFailed`` and exits as a no-op success, reporting against its own task token so the
workflow task does not wait out its timeout.

A manual run writes no claim: a user who asks to stream an asset gets an upload even when the
content is unchanged.

A claim that is not followed by a successful upload is released again by ``pipelineEnd`` (or by the
lambda that detected the failure), so a failed run does not leave the content permanently skipped.

The claim records its owner, a digest of the execution's workflow task token. A retried put whose
first attempt landed but whose response was lost meets the caller's OWN claim and fails with
``PreconditionFailed``; reading the owner back tells that apart from another execution's claim, which
would otherwise skip the upload and strand a claim that nothing releases.

Per-database scoping is NOT handled here: a database-scoped trigger fires only for uploads in its
own database, which VAMS resolves natively during trigger matching.
