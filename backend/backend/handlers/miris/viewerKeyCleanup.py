"""DynamoDB stream consumer that deletes expired per-view Miris viewer keys.

Each per-view viewer key VAMS mints is recorded in MirisViewerKeyStorageTable under its Miris key
ID, with a `ttl` after the key's expiry. An expired key stays in the Miris workspace until it is
deleted, so when DynamoDB TTL removes the row, this handler deletes the key from Miris.

The event source mapping filters the KEYS_ONLY stream to TTL deletions: `REMOVE` records whose
`userIdentity` is the DynamoDB service. Any other record that reaches the handler is skipped.

A record whose key could not be deleted is reported in `batchItemFailures` under its
`dynamodb.SequenceNumber`, so Lambda retries from that record rather than from the start of the
batch. A failed record without a `SequenceNumber` cannot be reported on its own, so the handler
raises after the batch and Lambda retries the whole batch. A key Miris no longer has counts as
deleted, which keeps a retried record idempotent. A record whose key ID is not a UUID is logged
and skipped, since no retry can delete it.
